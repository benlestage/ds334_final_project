# ds334_final_project

For my Final Project, I have built a shiny app using St. Lawrence Men's Ice Hockey data from the past four seasons. Users can break the data down by position, and the app creates scatter plots showing individual player statistics - such as points, penalties, and plus minus - per game. The user will notice that despite having rather lackluster individual statistics, the table output showing season record including which round of the ECAC tournament the team was eliminated in, that the team was rather successful. This is explained when the user selects goalie under position, where the stellar goaltending is demonstrated through individual statistics such as save percentage per game. This demonstrates that the success of the team was largely made possible by the goaltending.
